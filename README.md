# clone-everything

## what is it?
Big storms are hitting my area and I knew that I'd want a copy of all my repos in case I go offline. This script takes a github token and uses it to grab a quick copy of all of your github repositories. Nothing more, nothing less. For the record, the power went out as soon as I generated the token and hit "start". 

## how do I use it?

1. go here and generate a classic github token: settings -> developer settings -> generate classic token

2. either put the token in an export statement in your environment, or run it inline when you run the program like this `GITHUB_TOKEN=iuwbiuwhe89h2948uhf3iu4nf3 ./clone-everything`
